	<statement id="1">The evidence from rapid reviews is good enough to inform low-risk, emergent policy or decision-making needs when the alternative is the use of no evidence.</statement>
	<statement id="2">When time allows, a comprehensive systematic review of all available evidence should always be conducted.</statement>
	<statement id="3">Deviating from accepted systematic review methods may introduce bias and impact the validity of the resulting rapid review, which may be an unacceptable risk for some knowledge users (practitioners).</statement>
	<statement id="4">Further research comparing the methods and results of rapid reviews and systematic reviews is required before I decide how I feel about rapid reviews.</statement>
	<statement id="5">Rapid reviews are too focused in scope and/or context to be generalizable to a variety of knowledge users (practitioners).</statement>
	<statement id="6">Rapid reviews mean different things to different people.</statement>
	<statement id="7">Rapid reviews should only precede a more comprehensive and rigorous systematic review.</statement>
	<statement id="8">The opportunity cost of a comprehensive systematic review is too high and it is more advantageous to conduct rapid reviews when timeliness is a factor.</statement>
	<statement id="9">Rapid reviews do not replace systematic reviews.</statement>
